# Advent-of-Code-2023
Advent of Code 2023

This year, I'm going to try to do the Advent of Code in C++.

## How to run

You can run the code by doing:

```bash
make day[number]
```

And then :

```bash
./bin/day[number]/part[1|2]
```

## How to get the time

You can get the time by doing:

```bash	
make timer
```

And then :

```bash
./bin/timer ./bin/day[number]/part[1|2]
```

Note that the timer also takes the time to read the input file.
